            <h3>Welcome to my Portfolio website for ENG4U ISU (Independent Study Unit).</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 2">
              Hi everyone, welcome to my portfolio for ENG4U (Independent Study Unit). My name is Phone Pyae Thet Khine and I am a 19 years old Computer Science student studying in The Yorkville School attending Grade-12 (OSSD). I am obsessed with technology, especially in the software part. I grew up surrounded by technology in the early ages of computers in Myanmar. I had access to computers, hardware and most importantly, the internet and is exposed to immense knowledge that the internet can provide. And this was when most of the Burmese people didn’t know what the internet was. Now I can code in many different languages, build websites and program applications and a lot more.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 2">
              Computers are not the only thing that I am good at. I would describe myself as a very well-rounded person because I have experience in almost all fields. In academics, I am good in Maths and Physics and got high marks in my previous semesters. I am not just an academic though, I do sports too, sports such as badminton, and football, among them, my favourite is running. I have participated in marathons in the past and completed them. Not only I completed running in the marathons, I also volunteered in the preparation of those events.
            </p>

            <p style="line-height: 2">
              The Great Gatsby is the third novel written by an American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald and the first edition published in 1925 by the Charles Scribner's Sons in New York. It is a fictional historical novel based on the real-life events in the 1920 also known as the roaring twenties where the American and Western economy surged and created an era of mass consumerism and the Prohibition, a ban on the sales of alcohol. The book has inspirations from the author’s personal life and shares some common things in Fitzgerald and Gatsby, and Ginevra and Daisy. The novel discusses many themes such as wealth, class, old money, new money, corruption, love, affairs, and most importantly the decline of the American dream.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 2">
              The novel is narrated by Nick Caraway, a graduate from Yale University who wants moves to New York city to conduct some bond business. He lives in a place called the East Egg where his small bungalow is surrounded by huge mansions and waterfront houses owned by the newly rich self-made millionaires. On the other hand, in West Egg, lives people who has been in a position of power and wealth for many generations. These people did not make the money they have but was inherited.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 2">
              One day Nick travels to West Egg to visit Daisy his cousin, who is married to Tom Buchanan, a man with aristocratic manners and inherited wealth. There he sees Jordan Baker, who is a friend of Daisy and later his romantic interest in the book. Jay Gatsby, who is a neighbour of Nick later found out that Nick is a cousin of Daisy who is Gatsby’s former lover before the World War One. So, he took Nick out to show him the city and confronts him to invite Daisy to tea so that he can meet her again. Gatsby also throws lavish parties at his house every week where lots of wealthy people, government officials, and celebrities alike attend. But Gatsby was hoping that Daisy would come by seeing all those people and the luxurious displays. After some consideration, Nick invited Daisy to tea. There, Gatsby and Daisy met again after five years and decided that they still have feelings for each other. They started having an affair since then. Daisy’s husband, Tom is also cheating on her with a married women Myrtle, who lives in the Valley of Ashes between downtown New York and the two eggs. When the Buchanan couple went to Gatsby’s party, Tom was not impressed by the people who attends and the luxurious displays that Gatsby conjured using his immense wealth and expresses how he thinks Gatsby has gotten this much money to spend while consuming the alcohol that is served. He also despises the newly rich and mocks that they don’t have manners or does not know how to be polite.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 2">
              Gatsby persuades Daisy to divorce Tom but she hesitates. Even though she did not get the love that she wants from Tom, she still gets the wealth and the status that comes with Tom and she did not want to lose that.  On the day that they all went to the Plaza Hotel, Tom and Gatsby expose each other’s trade secrets and fight for Daisy to win her love back, and Gatsby nearly hit Tom. On the way back they Gatsby and Tom switched cars and drove back home. On the way Myrtle run to the car thinking that it was Tom’s but the yellow car hit her and she died. Turns out that Daisy was driving the car and Gatsby took the blame for it. Tom sees the accident and informs George Wilson, who was driving the car that hit his wife. And he goes on to kill him by putting a bullet through his heart.

            <p><strong><i>The Metaphorsis</i> - by Franz Kafka</strong></p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p style="line-height: 2">
              The Metamorphosis is one of the best-known works of Franz Kafka, a short-story writer and a novelist. It tells the story about a man named Gregor Samsa who’s occupation is a salesman waking up one morning only to see himself in some kind of a big insect. Gregor first thought that this was temporary but he soon realizes that the vermin form is there to stay. His voice sounds different when his mother, father, and sister notices something is wrong and knock on his door, causing them to think that he is unwell. Even his supervisor comes to his house to see why he missed his train to conduct business. The supervisor accuses Gregor that he has been misusing the firm’s money, he rushes out of the room trying to deny the accusations. But with his appearance, the supervisor runs away. Even his mother fainted seeing the ungodly figure. His father kicked him back into his room leaving him bleeding and injured while his sister cries.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 2">
              In the next morning, when his sister brings him food and fresh milk which is his favourite, Gregor, in his form, did not appetize with it but when she switches those with spoiled rotten food, he immediately eats them like those are the best thing in the world. He listens in on the family talking through a hole and learns about their money problems from within the room. Gregor fears that he can no longer provide for his family. Time went by and the Samsa household hires a cheaper maid to take care of Gregor, but she leaves the door open. This makes him hear the sound of violin playing by his sister from inside his room so he goes outside to listen properly and make up with Grete who he has been ignoring lately. But the lodgers saw him and are horrified with his appearance and left without even paying for the time they lived. 
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 2">
              Grete then discusses with her parents on how to get rid of the parasite that has taken over their lives. Gregor went back to his room and dies due to an apple stuck in his body appendage thrown by his father. The maid finds his body the day after and the Samsa family moved away with a bright future waiting for them.
